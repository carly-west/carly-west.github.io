        <h3>Butlerville Days</h3>
        <p> The Butlerville Days committee is excited to announce that this year’s event will be held July 19 – 24,
             with fun activities each day. We always strive to provide a safe and affordable family event for all of our residents. 
             With the challenges of the past year, we are taking extra steps to keep everyone safe. To meet this goal,
              we have decided not to have the carnival or inflatables for this year. In their place, the committee is working on creating a
               full week of fun filled activities in the city. </p>
